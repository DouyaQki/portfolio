      <ul>
        <li tabindex="5">CPU: Central Processing Unit</li>
      </ul>

      <p tabindex="6">Hiroshi Yamauchi’s instructions to design a console which would be cheaper than the competition
        resulted in
        Nintendo deciding to use an outdated Central Processing Unit (CPU). Although a 16-bit processor would have coped
        with ease, to keep the price low they decided to use a variant of the 8-bit 6502 processor, developed by MOS
        technology in 1975. The chip would be sufficient to run the programs but would be unable to generate the
        graphics required so the company decided to use a second chip as a dedicated Picture Processing Unit (PPU),
        responsible for calculating and displaying the graphics. Figure 1-4 shows the top of the motherboard with the
        CPU and PPU indicated.</p>
      <p tabindex="7">Ricoh produced an NMOS processor based on the 6502, the 2A03. The chip differed from a standard
        6502 in that it
        had the ability to handle sound, serving as pAPU (pseudo-Audio Processing Unit) as well as CPU, and that it
        lacked a Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) mode which allowed representing each digit using 4 bits. For the purposes of
        programming, the 2A03 uses the same instruction set as the standard 6502 which is shown in figure 2-1.</p>

      <code
        tabindex="8">The 6502 is a little endian processor which means that addresses are stored in memory least significant byte first, for example the address $1234 would be stored in memory as $34 at memory location x and $12 at memory location (x + 1).</code>

      <header>
        <h2 class="general-text-color" accesskey="2" tabindex="9">PPU MEMORY MAP</h2>
      </header>

      <ul>
        <li tabindex="10">PPU: Picture Processing Unit</li>
      </ul>

      <p tabindex="11">The PPU has its own memory, known as VRAM (Video RAM). Like the CPU, the PPU can also address 64
        KB of memory
        although it only has 16 KB of physical RAM. The PPU’s memory map is shown in figure 3-1. Again, the left hand
        map shows a simplified version which is elaborated on by the right hand map. Due to the difference between
        physical and logical address spaces, any address above $3FFF is wrapped around, making the logical memory
        locations $4000-$FFFF effectively a mirror of locations $0000-$3FFF.</p>
      <p tabindex="12">Reading from and writing to PPU memory can be done by using the I/O registers $2006 and $2007 in
        CPU memory.
        This is usually done during V-Blank at the end of a frame, as it affects addresses used while drawing the screen
        and can therefore corrupt what is displayed. However, this effect can be used to produce split screen effects.
      </p>

      <code
        tabindex="13">Ricoh also supplied the 2C02 to serve as PPU. The PPU’s registers are mostly located in the I/O registers section of CPU memory at $2000-$2007 and $4014</code>

        <h2 class="general-text-color" accesskey="3" tabindex="14">COLOR PALETTE</h2>
      </header>

      <p tabindex="15">The NES has a colour palette containing 52 colours although there is actually room for 64.
        However, not all of
        these can be displayed at a given time. The NES uses two palettes, each with 16 entries, the image palette
        ($3F00-$3F0F) and the sprite palette ($3F10-$3F1F). The image palette shows the colours currently available for
        background tiles.</p>
      <p tabindex="16">The sprite palette shows the colours currently available for sprites. These palettes do not store
        the actual
        colour values but rather the index of the colour in the system palette. Since only 64 unique values are needed,
        bits 6 and 7 can be ignored.</p>

      <ul>
        <li tabindex="17">Colours onscreen: 25 out of 52</li>
      </ul>

      <code
        tabindex="18">The total number of colours onscreen at any time is therefore 25 out of 52. Both palettes are also mirrored to $3F20-$3FFF. The colour palette is shown in Appendix F.</code>

        <h2 class="general-text-color" accesskey="4" tabindex="19">DIRECT MEMORY ACCESS</h2>
      </header>

      <p tabindex="20">When transferring a large amount of data between devices it is inefficient to transfer this
        through the
        processor. To transfer data from CPU memory to sprite memory, for example, takes the following steps:</p>

      <ul>
        <li tabindex="21">Load required SPR-RAM address into CPU.</li>
        <li tabindex="22">Write required SPR-RAM address to $2003.</li>
        <li tabindex="23">Load byte into CPU.</li>
        <li tabindex="24">Write byte to $2004.</li>
      </ul>

      <p tabindex="25">When filling the contents of sprite memory, this technique would have to be repeated 256 times.
        Direct Memory
        Access (DMA) is a technique which allows more efficient copying of data from CPU memory to sprite memory. Using
        DMA, the whole of sprite memory can be filled by using a single instruction, a write to $4014. The starting
        address in CPU memory is specified by the operand for the write multiplied by $100. The 256 bytes starting at
        this address are copied directly into sprite memory without the further involvement of the CPU.</p>

      <code
        tabindex="26">Using DMA, the whole of sprite memory can be filled by using a single instruction, a write to $4014.</code>

    <section class="main-section" id="SPRITES_ON_SCREEN">
      <header>
        <h2 class="general-text-color" accesskey="5" tabindex="27">SPRITES ON SCREEN</h2>
      </header>

      <p tabindex="28">Sprites are the characters to draw on the screen. Sprites can be either 8x8 pixels or 8x16
        pixels. Most
        characters are composed of multiple sprites.</p>
      <p tabindex="28">The sprite data is stored in the pattern tables while the sprite attributes are stored in
        SPR-RAM. There are a
        maximum of 64 sprites, each of which uses four bytes in SPR-RAM. The bytes work as follows:</p>

      <ul>
        <li tabindex="29">Byte 0 - Stores the y-coordinate of the top left of the sprite minus 1.</li>
        <li tabindex="30">Byte 1 - Index number of the sprite in the pattern tables.</li>
        <li tabindex="31">Byte 2 - Stores the attributes of the sprite.</li>
        <li tabindex="32">Bits 0-1 - Most significant two bits of the colour.</li>
        <li tabindex="33">Bit 5 - Indicates whether this sprite has priority over the background.</li>
        <li tabindex="34">Bit 6 - Indicates whether to flip the sprite horizontally.</li>
        <li tabindex="35">Bit 7 - Indicates whether to flip the sprite vertically.</li>
      </ul>

      <code
        tabindex="36">Sprites can be read or written one at a time by first writing the required address to $2003 and then reading or writing $2004. Alternatively the whole of SPR-RAM can be written in one DMA operation by writing to $4014.</code>
